# Convolutional Neural Network
This project implements a neural network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The notebook is specifically configured for use in Google Colab with GPU acceleration.
## Project Overview
### Training Dataset
CIFAR-10.
### Model
Convolutional Neural Network.
### Enviroment
Google Colab / Google Drive for file managment.
## Usage

Open the ``CNN.ipynb`` file in Google Colab.

Authorize the Google Drive usage for saving the model ``cifar10_cnn_model.h5``
